# Exercise 2

Using the sys built-in module print the path list where Python looks for modules.

## Expected result

expected result may differ, however, it should look like this:

```cmd
['/usr/lib/python311.zip', '/usr/lib/python3.11', '/usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload', '/home/ermias/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages', '/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3.11/dist-packages']
```
